### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am very happy you are here! Let me introduce myself:
I am **Cinzia** a freelance Full Stack Developer who has been passionate about everything related to this world for more than ten years. I love my job very much and consider myself very lucky for it ğŸ’–  

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some interesting projects for my customers
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on hydroponics, ethical horsemanship and restoration of antique furniture
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started getting into computing when I was 5 years old, at first my dad let me use his Windows 95. Unfortunately, I never could stand clutter (and my dad was very cluttered ğŸ«£) so I used to tidy up from time to time when I found messy folders... Until I started to tidy up the system folders as well and... I blew up the operating system completely. But I was very grateful to my dad that he didn't get angry with me ğŸ˜Š
